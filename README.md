# Camera Distance

Unlocks the 3rd person camera's maximum viewing distance.
If you want the camera to be like the "Harrowhold camera" all of the time, then set the variable OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_SETTINGS to true and DEFAULT_MAX_DISTANCE to 1200. 
You can customize the camera's max distance in-game by using the "camera [distance]" command. 
Requires tera-data files from at least 4-25-2017.
